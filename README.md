# Docker 101 Node and Mongo

Get started by running:

    docker-compose up -d

This will build and start the `api`, `db`, and `webserver` containers in the background. You can access the API 
at [http://localhost:8000/api/movies](http://localhost:8000/api/movies) (substitute your Docker host address if it is
not `localhost`).
